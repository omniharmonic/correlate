# Quantum Computing Fundamentals

## Overview

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational approaches, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena to process information.

## Core Concepts

### Quantum Bits (Qubits)

Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in superposition states, enabling parallel computation across multiple possibilities.

### Quantum Entanglement

Entanglement creates correlations between qubits that persist regardless of physical separation, enabling quantum communication protocols.

## Applications

Current and future applications include:
- Cryptography and security
- Drug discovery and molecular modeling
- Financial modeling
- Machine learning optimization

## Challenges

The field faces significant challenges in maintaining quantum coherence and scaling quantum systems.
