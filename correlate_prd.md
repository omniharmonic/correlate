### Product Requirement Document: Correlate (A Standalone Application)

#### 1. Introduction

"Correlate" is a standalone application designed to facilitate the intelligent convergence of two distinct Markdown libraries. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Correlate enables seamless translation of YAML frontmatter schemas and tags between libraries, thereby promoting interoperability and knowledge sharing across disparate documentation sets. This PRD outlines the functionality and technical requirements for Correlate as a self-contained desktop application.

**Status Update (2025-06-19)**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All core features implemented and validated through comprehensive end-to-end testing.

#### 2. Goals

* ✅ To intelligently correlate and translate YAML frontmatter schemas and tags between two distinct Markdown libraries using LLMs.
* ✅ To enable the publication of documents from one library into another with automatically translated tags, after human verification.
* ✅ To provide a user-friendly, standalone interface for schema selection, LLM configuration, and review of tag translations.
* ✅ To operate independently, reading from and writing to the local file system.
* ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: To preserve unmapped metadata as generic "tags" when correlation confidence is low.
* ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: To generate contextual "Related" links between documents using semantic similarity analysis.

#### 3. Key Features - **ALL IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
